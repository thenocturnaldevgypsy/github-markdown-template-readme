## ![SECTION About this Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/‚ùî-About%20this%20Repository-%2300416a?logoColor=white&labelColor=%2300416a&color=%2324292e&textColor=white)
`DuskGrimoires` is an old library that contains Java source codes I've coded and used during my career as Assistant Professor for BSCS, BSIT and BSCOE way back late 2012 to 2015.

> [!NOTE]
> *I've created this repo as a reminder to myself that Java was one of the programming languages I got **heavily** exposed when I was teaching in College/University. It's also a good way to refresh my Java, GitHub and Markdown skills. And just a reminder, the codes here were initially made way back 2012 and been updated regularly until 2015. So I only did some **best effort** to make sure that the codes that are in this repo can be compiled and can be read thru by users.*

| Version | Date | Commit | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 2.1.1 | 14.09.2024 | [118e2d1](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/duskgrimoires-java-lab-exercises/commit/118e2d10dc55f82a5ec38dc68f928fc9a9e0c3b7) for [PR 6](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/duskgrimoires-java-lab-exercises/pull/6), [3a2fac0](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/duskgrimoires-java-lab-exercises/commit/3a2fac08c539f0ce0c766b9337e62880358e477e) for [PR 7](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/duskgrimoires-java-lab-exercises/pull/7) | fix | - Updated Markdown files structure overall based on the template: https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/github-markdown-template-readme/blob/master/MD%20Templates/Repo-App-README-v-0-0-1.md. Updated README.md. Created DSAA-LabExercise-Prelim.md, DSAA-LabExercise-Prelim.md, DSAA-LabExercise-Prelim.md and DSAA-LabExercise-Prelim.md to separate Demo and Exercise user stories / descriptions from the original README.md ([PR 6](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/duskgrimoires-java-lab-exercises/pull/6)).<br>- Updated directory structure. Deleted "programmingessentialsoop" subdirectory, and replace it with "computerprogramming1", "computerprogramming2" and "computerprogramming3" subdirectories. Created main classes for each subdirectories and the corresponding "on-going" placements ([PR 7](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/duskgrimoires-java-lab-exercises/pull/7)).|
| 2.0.0 | 06.09.2024 | [ea3bb0a](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/duskgrimoires-java-lab-exercises/commit/ea3bb0aa0020fb29324b15cfc9b5f24ca78b87e5) | fix & feat | - Recreated repo from `duskgrimoire-java-lab-exercises` to `duskgrimoires-java-lab-exercises` <br>- Continued separating source codes per subject / topic via subdirectory. <br>- Renamed subdirectory `data-structure-algorithm-analysis` to `datastructurealgorithmanalysis` and created `DataStrucAlgoAnalysis.java` to serve as the Table of Contents for the Apps under `Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis`. <br>- Created subdirectory `programmingessentialsoop` and created `ProgEssentialsOOP.java` to serve as the Table of Contents for the Apps under `Programming Essentials to OOP`. <br>- Updated `App.java` to serve as the Table of Contents for the overall App. |
| 1.1.2 | 01.09.2024 | -- | feat | Started separating source codes per subject / topic via subdirectory. Created `data-structure-algorithm-analysis` |
| 1.1.1 | 29.08.2024 | -- | feat | Cloned the original repo `java-labcodes-exercises-dsaa` to the new repo `duskgrimoires-java-lab-exercises` for public viewing purposes. |
| 1.1.0 | 07-08/05, 2024 | -- | fix | - Done with updating all renamed classes, noticed that `Prefinal_Exercise1_Trees.java` has incomplete codes. Will be looking for my backup (or just rewrite it) and I'll upload it in this repo soon ([Issue #1](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/duskgrimoires-java-lab-exercises/issues/3)). <br>- Tried pulling the repo to my local unit using VS Code, need to retweak `App.java`, especially if some users wanted to try it out and won't get confused with the menu, reuploaded all required folders and source codes. <br>- Created `java-labcodes-exercises-dsaa` GitHub `public` repository, added MIT License, and uploaded the original Java codes that I've used way back 2012. |
