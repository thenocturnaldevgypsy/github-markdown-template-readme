## ![SECTION About this Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/❔-About%20this%20Repository-%2300416a?logoColor=white&labelColor=%2300416a&color=%2324292e&textColor=white)
`DuskGrimoires` is an old library that contains Java source codes I've coded and used during my career as Assistant Professor for BSCS, BSIT and BSCOE way back late 2012 to 2015.

I've created this repo as a reminder to myself that Java was one of the programming languages I got **heavily** exposed when I was teaching in College/University. It's also a good way to refresh my Java, GitHub and Markdown skills. And just a reminder, the codes here were initially made way back 2012 and been updated regularly until 2015. So I only did some **best effort** to make sure that the codes that are in this repo can be compiled and can be read thru by users.
